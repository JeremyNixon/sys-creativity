The first version of systematizing creativity came out of applying abstraction and generalization to ideas lists, _using idea lists_.

The original:

1. Intentionally enter diffuse mode over ideas
2. Idea Lists
3. Transfer / Abstract over similar solutions
4. Multinomial Trees (Ed Boyden)
5. Graphs of relationship between ideas (Ex., Optimizer / Model / Loss Function)
* Optimizing supervised learning with reinforcement learning (architecture search)
* Optimizing reinforcement learning with supervised learning (Policy Network / Value Network)
6. Combining, connecting ideas / Idea Sex
7. Leading questions
* Resource constraints (time, attention, money, assumptions, etc.)
* Resource excess (time, attention, money, etc.)
* Eliminating options
* Imagine the future (problem is solved, for ex.). What happened? Work backwards.
8. Brainstorm [thought dumping]
9. Generalization - if you've solved a problem, extend the solution to its farthest reaches
10. Listing approaches to a body of problems (say ML toolbox, or models in how to think)
11. Randomize. Generate random ideas by specifying some parameters, and make them work / use them as prompts.
12. List and reject assumptions
13. Multiple levels of abstraction
14. Apply different modes of processing
15. Current Knowledge frames ideas. Break out of frame with:
* Looking at problem from perspective of another person, another category of thinker
16. Defend a difficult position, adversarial conversation
17. Think ground up, from first principles
18. Deconstruction + Optimization
19. Metaphor Generation
