title: Generating Thiel Answers
---

The Thiel Question — what is a truth very few people agree with you on — is a fantastic descriptor of contrarian truth, and a terrible generator. Here are some generators for the next time Thiel appears out of nowhere to stump you:

  

1.  What about the world is broken that no one knows is broken?
    
2.  What do most people get wrong about everything?
    
3.  What massive societal change is coming that no one knows is coming?
    
4.  What massive technological change is coming that no one knows is coming?
    
5.  What has been fundamentally misunderstood?
    
6.  What truths are too terrifying for us to admit?
    
7.  What do you do that you wish everyone did?
    
8.  What supposedly implausible scenarios are actually possible, or fairly likely?
    
9.  What dystopian future must actually be guarded against?
    
10.  What halcyon future may be possible to build?
