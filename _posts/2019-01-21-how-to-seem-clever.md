title: Seeming Clever

Sampling over a high-variance distribution lets you hide mistakes, losses, bad outcomes, unluckiness, wild failures and capture the gains of successes, well-thought plans, luck, and wild victories. If failures are hidden and successes visible, this gives the appearance of brilliance. The greater the variance and the more sampling, the greater the brilliance. You take the best of what has been figured out and leave the rest, as in:



1.  Writing pages and pages of ideas over years, sampling the best
    
2.  Speaking at parties, then compiling and selecting the best
    
3.  Becoming a venture capitalist, with a portfolio of one Google and 100 Jucieros
    
4.  As a researcher, running 100 experiments and publishing the one that works
    
5.  Random selection of books in a library, or video on Youtube, and watching the best after a 30 second test
    

  

The safer you are from ruin — from being taken out of the game — the more it pays to be wild.

  

The implication is to not be fooled by ostensible cleverness, check the base rate. How many experiments, or investments, or investors, would we expect to see succeed by chance alone.
