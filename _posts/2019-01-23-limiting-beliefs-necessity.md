Creativity and its natural supporters — curiosity, openness, the inquisitive spirit, the itch to know — are often considered opponents of necessity. Necessity, need, the vulgar material world, money are the death of the creative spirit.

Not so. Necessity cuts through reality, sharpens curiosity. We confuse the pressures of necessity, and particularly those impositions made on us by others, with the killing the creative output. Rather, take time and space to think about the problems you deem worthy, that really affect you, that you must solve and you will find your creativity sharpened by the world.
