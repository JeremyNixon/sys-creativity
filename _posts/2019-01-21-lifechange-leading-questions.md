Creativity is best applied to relevant problems in your life. One way to bring these to mind, and which can later operate as raw material to run systematizing creativity on, is to ask leading questions. Use all, some, or none:

2.  What do you wish was different in your life?
    
3.  What do you always wish you could do?
    
4.  What do you think you could never do, but would want to?
    
5.  What would your friends tell you to do?
    
6.  What scares you?
    
7.  What frustrates you?
    
8.  What confuses you?
    
9.  What interests you?
    
10.  What questions are you grappling with right now?

12.  What do most people get wrong about everything?
