### Jeremy Nixon
Jeremy's identity was identitilessness, until identitilessness realiezed that it, itself, was an identity and so destroyed itself by creating an identity, and then loops, recursively, destroying that identity to reaffirm identitilessness.

In a bid to become uncompressible, Jeremy maximized his worldview for variance (relative to himself). After re-modeling and re-compressing himself, he created and internalized novel conceptual schemes, creating new variance and re-uncompressing himself, just to model himself and become compressed and uninteresting once more.
