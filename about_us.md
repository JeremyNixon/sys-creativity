# Who we are

### Jeremy Nixon
Jeremy's identity was identitilessness, until identitilessness realized that it, itself, had become an identity. And so it destroyed itself by creating an identity, and then looped and loops, recursively, destroying identity to reaffirm identitilessness, and destroying identitilessness to reaffirm identitilessnes.

In a bid to become uncompressible, Jeremy maximized his worldview for valuable self-variance. After re-modeling and so re-compressing himself, flagging in uncompressibility, he created and internalized novel conceptual schemes, creating new variance and re-uncompressing himself, just to model himself and become compressed and uninteresting once more. He's currently looking to discover, create and internalize new and valuable modes of thinking.
