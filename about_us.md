### Jeremy Nixon
Jeremy's identity was identitilessness, until identitilessness realized that it, itself, had become an identity. And so it destroyed itself by creating an identity, and then looped and loops, recursively, destroying identity to reaffirm identitilessness, and destroying identitilessness to reaffirm identitilessnes.

In a bid to become uncompressible, Jeremy maximized his worldview for valuable self-variance. After re-modeling and so re-compressing himself, flagging in uncompressibility, he created and internalized novel conceptual schemes, creating new variance and re-uncompressing himself, just to model himself and become compressed and uninteresting once more. He's currently looking to discover, create and internalize new and valuable modes of thinking.

### Christopher Read
Too, too much bloodless abstraction, disembodied skull — dead bone. We are all sculptors of self. Where is this thing you say you are? In this age of abundance, where the demand of survival have given way to the need for restraint, where the ignorant have given way to the over-educated, where the hungry have given way to the bloated and rotund, the critical task is judgment — judgment under endless choice! It is the ultimate choice to decide on a self. It is the last question, the only real, at-bottom question: how do you become what you are?

An impossibly high-dimensional problem, the second most complicated problem in existence. This problem, like all problems, is a problem of information. It has a structure. There is a law. And to know these laws is to literally recreate the world at will. It is to solve the problem of problems.

Christopher seeks these laws.
